<h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
<p>
Currently there is a major issue regarding the impact that instant messaging has in academic institutions such as schools, colleges, and universities on a national level, even though it has proven to be a useful tool over the years since it pioneered but it has also at the same time proven to be a useful tool in invading the privacy of our private life. The use of instant messaging for academic purposes by students is rising and shows no sign in ever stopping at any given rate which is why I intend to conduct this investigation to share my findings and raise awareness about the threat that instant messaging poses in the private life of students.
<br/>
<br/><br/>My investigation will focus on the following three subtopics which are:<br/><br/>

What instant messaging is here, I looked into the background of instant messaging such as how it came about and also how it works, I’ll search and provide the various types of instant messaging platforms that are available worldwide but specifically the ones which students commonly use.
What are the pros and cons of instant messaging are, here I looked into discussing the benefits that instant messaging provides to its student users as well as the negative effects to allow my target audience to argue for themselves if which between the pros and the cons out weights the other strongly enough to encourage them to be more cautious or careless when using instant messaging.
How can one manager their instant messaging use, since I’ll be stating the negative effects of instant messaging, I will also provide solutions to tackle those effects solely to inform the students that want to continue with the use of instant messaging but are curious about how to go about it in a responsible and safe manner.
<br/><br/>I investigated how instant messaging impacts the private life of academic institutions such as schools, colleges and universities on a national level then I will formulate questions to assist in guiding me through my research which will explore the background of instant messaging, the pros and cons of instant messaging and also how one can manage their instant messaging use while providing the research methods and sources that I used to qualify information that support my findings but I’ll ensure that I critically assess the information sources before starting my final report towards the end of phase 1.
<br/><br/>My Report consists of questionnaire/survey that I will design and implement by sharing amongst students over the nation by means of social media platforms such Facebook, twitter etc. to get valid and genuine feedback regarding my topic which will help me acquire accurate data that I will analyse in spreadsheets and database.
<br/><br/>My report includes my findings, conclusions and providing recommendations on how to deal will the issue brought about by instant messaging for students. I will go about representing my findings by completing the word-processed report, create a website to report the process, findings and recommendations.
This research is aimed at the students attending academic institutions such as schools, colleges and universities that use or want start using instant messaging.
My entire research will be focused on answering the question which is how does instant messaging impact the daily lives of students at academic institutions nationwide.

<h2><u>Instant messaging background</u></h2>
Instant Messaging, which is commonly known as IM or IM’ing, is the process of exchanging of nearly real time text messages by means of a standalone application or embedded software. Compared to chatrooms which has many users interacting in multiple and overlapping conversations, IM periods usually happen between two or more users in a secure private back and forth way of communication (Nast, 15 June 2022). Students use instant messaging such as WhatsApp messenger, messenger for Facebook in order to communicate with teachers in terms of asking for assistance with homework and assignments. Instant messaging makes an impact on students on a national level because it enables communication not only locally but worldwide which means students from different nations or within the same nation can communicate together in real lifetime.
