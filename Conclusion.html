<h2><u>Deduction</u></h2>
<p>
I researched the nationwide problem of the lack of awareness amongst students and the impact it has on their privacy and productivity at academic institutions. I focused mainly on students who are currently in high school and in universities and colleges since the education at their level requires them to make use of instant messaging. Based on my findings I found out that a majority of my respondents spend too much time engaging in instant messaging which hinders them from being productive during school hours however there are a few students who are careless with their privacy when using instant messaging to the point that they upload their school information to public websites whenever they post picture of themselves in uniform or when recording their daily activity as school which allows strangers to have access to. My conclusion is the level of usage of instant messaging at academic institution differs from individual students according to the level of education they are currently completing.
